# love-bed

## Intent

This project is built using [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), and is a test bed of sorts to try out some libraries and development practices that I've had on the back-burner for awhile.

## Concepts

### Test Driven Development

While I'm familiar with Unit Testing both in theory and practice, I've wanted to try Test Driven Development on a project for some time.

### Entity Component System

I'm an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) developer, through and through. While I've read into other design patterns here and there, I've never felt the need to step outside of my comfort zone. Until now, that is.
